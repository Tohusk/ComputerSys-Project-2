    // How to get started

    // Read specification
    // Start with reading the packet from stdin (standard input, STDIN_FILENO or file descriptor 0) stream using read(2) or read(3) man read call. Refer to 2.1 paragraph 2 about the first 2 bytes of the packet.
    // Recommendation: Print out/screenshot and annotate a hex dump of a DNS packet, referring to the mini-specification of the packet format (Reference [1] at end of specification).
    // Leave a couple of blank lines for your annotations, as the information can get quite dense.
    // Alternatively, capture a packet with wireshark and highlight the various fields relevant for the project or @615.
    // Alternatively, look at and understand the annotated sample: https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/107590/assignments/205862
    // Extract the various field required for this project from packets using what you learnt from week 7 practical and what you learnt about DNS packet format in previous step.
    // Print the log.
    // Attempt to modularise your code and make it reusable (if you didnâ€™t do so during implementation).
